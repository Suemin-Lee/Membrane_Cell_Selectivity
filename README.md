# Membrane & Cell Selectivity

This repository contains code for computing the competitive and non-competitive cases of MIC, MHC, and MHC/MIC. The equations compute without any approximation that allows for the full analysis of the behaviors of the cell densities. Please change the parameter values for CB and CH as desired.

To generate the results, please run `no_approximation_membrane_select.ipynb`.
